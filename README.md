AWS CLI tools for CyberArk

This repository contains two separate codebases: a portable Python CLI which
will obtain short-term AWS credentials after you authenticate to Idaptive and a
PowerShell version which will only run on Microsoft Windows. Please consult the
README files in the directory for the tool which suits your needs.
